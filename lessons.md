بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيم
نحمده ونصلي على رسوله الكريم اما بعد

إِنَّا لِلّهِ وَإِنَّـا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ 

اللَّهُمَّ لَا مَانِعَ لِمَا أَعْطَيْتَ وَلَا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ، وَلَا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الْجَدِّ مِنْكَ الْجَد
(O Allah, there is none Who can avert what You grant or give what You deprive, and no fortune ever helps the fortunate against You)
